# MNIST-Neural-Network
Neural Network using sigmoid neurons with three total layers, input, hidden, and output
This network was made as a part of my Aritficial Intelligence course to solve the MNIST problem of recognizing and identifying hand-written digits
This assignment was written entirely in Java, yes, Java
Our professor had this to say when assigning the project, "Now, I know what you're thinking, "Dr. O'Neal, why the hell are we writing this in Java and not in Python, Java isn't built for AI." Exactly! So that you people can't just look up the answer online. That and so you have to really get into the details of the problem."
I spent roughly ~35 hours on the assignment although that is a very rough estimate and the actual number is likely less

To properly run the program, two .csv files must be included in the program's directory
One named "mnist_test.csv", which is included here
And another named "mnist_train.csv", which is not included because the file size is too large for the repository, although a download link is included
