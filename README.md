# MNIST-Neural-Network
Neural Network using sigmoid neurons with three total layers, input, hidden, and output, and is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent and back propagation
This network was made as a part of my Aritficial Intelligence course to solve the MNIST problem of recognizing and identifying hand-written digits
This assignment was written entirely in Java, yes, Java
Our professor had this to say when assigning the project, "Now, I know what you're thinking, "Dr. O'Neal, why the hell are we writing this in Java and not in Python, Java isn't built for AI." Exactly! So that you people can't just look up the answer online. That and so you have to really get into the details of the problem."
I spent roughly ~35 hours on the assignment although that is a very rough estimate and the actual number is likely less

To properly run the program, download the NeuralNetworkProgram.zip
Put the .zip file wherever you want it in your file system and extract the files
If you have an IDE such as Eclipse or Visual Studio Code, you can run the program in it
If not then the program can be run straight from Command Line

1. Hit the windows key and type then click "command prompt" to open up the command line
2. You must change your directory to the location of where you extracted the files to
   You can do this by copying the file path of the directory and in command line type "cd <right-click to paste>"
   Note that if the directory does not change, you may need to include "" around your pasted directory 
   ex:  cd "C:\GitHub\AI-Assignment-2"
3. Compile the program by typing the command "javac NeuralNetworkProgram.java"
4. Run the program by typing the command "java NeuralNetworkProgram"
   The program will take about 10-15 seconds to load the create the network then you will be prompted with a menu to interact with
